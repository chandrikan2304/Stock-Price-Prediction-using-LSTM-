# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-
This project demonstrates the use of Deep Learning, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), to predict stock prices based on historical data and market indicators. Designed to assist investors in making informed decisions, it combines robust data analysis techniques with machine learning to forecast future stock trends effectively.  

# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project leverages **Deep Learning**, particularly **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)**, to predict stock prices based on historical data and market indicators. The goal is to provide investors with accurate forecasts to make informed decisions, optimize strategies, and mitigate market risks.
